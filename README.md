# ATM Machine (Java)

A **console-based ATM simulation** built using Java to demonstrate **OOP concepts** like classes, objects, encapsulation, and method decomposition.

## ✨ Features
- 🔑 **PIN Verification** with a maximum of 3 attempts (card blocked after failure).
- 💰 **Check Balance** – View your current account balance.
- ➕ **Deposit Money** – Add funds with validation for valid amounts.
- ➖ **Withdraw Money** – Withdraw funds with insufficient balance checks.
- 🚪 **Exit Option** – Gracefully exit the ATM system.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (**Classes, Objects, Encapsulation**)
- **Control flow** (`if-else`, `switch`)
- **Recursion** (re-calling menu and PIN check)
- **User Input Handling** using `Scanner`
- **Constants** with `final`
- Basic **validation and error handling**

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ATM-Machine-Java.git
   cd ATM-Machine-Java
